# DataCleaning-Project-Portfolio
Cleaning a raw data set using SQL


In this project I have taken a raw Data set of a housing colony named as Nashville Housing.

The data was a rogue data that needed a lot of cleansing to make it more convinient. The rogue data is provided in the repository with the file name 
" Nashville Housing Data for Data Cleaning".

After writing multiple queries in SQL I finally cleaned the data according to my needs(Can be cleaned more). The queries i wrote to clean the data are provided in the 
epository with the file name "Data Refining".

And the final outcomes are also mentiond with the file name " Cleaned Data Nashville Housing".
